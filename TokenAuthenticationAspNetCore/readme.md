## Token Authentication in ASP.NET Core

Having trouble scaling because of server-based sessions? Token authentication removes the burden of storing session state on the server. Want to make the switch to token authentication, but don’t know how?

In this talk, Nate Barbettini, .NET Developer Evangelist at Stormpath, will demystify token authentication and cover topics such as:

* How session-based authentication works
* How token-based authentication works
* How to use cookies the right way
* Why JWTs make great tokens
* How are tokens secured?
* Validating tokens in ASP.NET Core
* Generating tokens in ASP.NET Core

You’ll learn how to use JWTs and token authentication to create a scalable and secure authentication and authorization layer for your application.
